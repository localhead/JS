About classes:
Classes allows to generate objects. 
Before we used to make an object literals

OOP has 4 fundamental principles:
Abstraction: Ignoring details that does not matter.

Encapsulation: Keeping properties and methods private inside of class.

Inheritance: Making all properties and methods 
of a certain class available to a child class.

Polymorphism: A child class can overwrite a
method it inherited from a parent class.
